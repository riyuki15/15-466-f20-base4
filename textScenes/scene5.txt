She is only one turn away from her home!
Gretel knows it, 
because she remember that leftover sushi was the second guide she put on the road.
She does not like sushi, and she does not like donuts either.
Gretel's mom is a big fan of Japanese cuisine.
That's partially the reason why she had a big quarrel with her father and mother.
Today is Gretel's birthday,
but nobody cares about what she really likes.
She got a big box of donuts, 
but the only present she wanted is a big cholocate birthday cake,
However, now she realized.
She wants nothing but everyone's smile.
She felt happy enough spending time with her family.

Which way shall we go?
-left (donut)
-right (chocolate candy)
