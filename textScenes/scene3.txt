While on the way home, Gretel was still so frightened 
by the fact that she was almost caught by the witch and could have lost her life. 
She actually doubted why a house made of so much sweets exists deep in the forest, 
but when she saw the fridge full of her favourite chocolate candies through the window, 
she did not think twice and walked towards the house.
Gretel's mom hates candies, 
and gets angry at her whenever she sees Gretel eats them.

Oh, the road diverges again. Which way shall she go?
