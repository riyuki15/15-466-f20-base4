"I'm getting closer and closer to my home!!",
Gretel says to herself.
She can smell the nice smell of the french crossiants 
her grandmother makes every morning.
She can always eat up all of them for breakfast.
She was so regretful at the moment, 
because she had quarrels with her parents, 
and ran away from home without saying anything.
"Grandma must have been so worried about me...",
Gretel cried because of her immaturity.

Which way shall we go?
