Gretel is a little girl who ran away from home after having quarrels with her parents. 
She only took some of her favourite snacks with her and unfortunately, 
she got lost in the forest, 
where she fell into the hands of a cannibalistic witch living in a house made of 
gingerbread, cake, confection, sweets, and many other treats and pastries. 
The witch intended to fatten her before eventually eating her, 
but Gretel outwitted the witch and killed her. 
She escaped from the witch's house, and wants to return home. 
She is very clever and put snacks every few steps away to guide her home. 

Which way shall she go?
