Game Over!
Bad ending unlocked!

The road seems so long that it will never come to an end.
lt is dreadfully cold.
And suddenly, it starts snowing fast, and almost dark.

Gretel has never felt so cold and hungry...

She misses her dad, her mom, and her grandma.
But only the thick, hard tree trunk was there beside her.
She fell to a sleep.
